# mclaunch
The old Minecraft Java launcher, updated.

## Well, where do I get it?
You can download the latest version from the Github releases page: [Releases](https://github.com/mclaunch/mclaunch/releases)

## What does this launcher have?
This launcher is made to bring back the old Java launcher fully working and updated. Here's a list of the things it has:

 + The old Java launcher
 + Full support for all Minecraft versions (all the way back to the Alpha versions)
 + An updated blog (The old MCUpdate blog has been discontinued, so we made our own on the [MCUpdate repository](https://github.com/mclaunch/mcupdate))
 + A good look
